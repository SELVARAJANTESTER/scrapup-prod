Local Git push checklist (Windows PowerShell):

# initialize and push
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - ScrapCollect demo"
# create a repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/<youruser>/<yourrepo>.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Notes:
# - If you have large files, consider using git lfs and add rules to .gitattributes.
# - If you want me to perform the push from this environment, provide a repo remote URL and an access token (not recommended here). Instead, run the commands locally.
# - After pushing, connect the GitHub repo to Render and Netlify for automated deploys.
